# transit-app
The Transit App is a Geographic Information System developed in C++.

**Overview**

The Transit App GIS addresses a significant gap in the transportation app market by providing the first comprehensive solution that combines multi-modal transport routing with points of interest (POI) integration on a single interactive map. Unlike existing apps that focus on single transportation modes, this application seamlessly integrates biking, public transit, and driving routes while displaying relevant POIs such as cafes, restaurants, hospitals, theatres, and other landmarks.


**Key Features**


**Multi-Modal Transportation Routing**

Integrated Route Planning: Combines bike, public transit, and driving directions in a single interface
Seamless Mode Transitions: Intelligently suggests optimal combinations of transportation methods
Real-time Updates: Incorporates live transit data and traffic conditions

**Advanced User Interface**

Predictive Search: Smart autocomplete functionality for destinations and POIs
Layered Transit Visualization: Clear, intuitive display of different transportation layers
Interactive Controls: Smooth panning, zooming, and map interaction
Auto-scaling: Dynamic map scaling based on route complexity and user preferences
Dark Mode: Eye-friendly interface option for low-light conditions
GTK Integration: Native desktop UI elements for enhanced responsiveness

**Optimized Pathfinding Algorithms**

Dijkstra's Algorithm with A Heuristics*: Implemented for shortest-path and time-based wayfinding
Performance Optimized: Efficient route calculation for complex multi-modal scenarios
Real-time Processing: Fast response times even with large datasets

**Travelling Salesman Problem Solver**

Advanced Optimization Techniques: Implements 2-opt, or-opt, and simulated annealing methods
Competitive Performance: Ranked top 10 among 100+ competitors



**Technical Implementation**


**Architecture**

API Integration: Seamlessly combines multiple transportation and mapping APIs
Modular Design: Clean separation between routing algorithms, UI components, and data management
Cross-platform Compatibility: Built with GTK for native desktop performance

**Performance Optimizations**

Algorithmic Efficiency: Custom implementations of classic pathfinding algorithms
Memory Management: Optimized data structures for large-scale route calculations and loading maps of large cities (like Tokyo)
Parallel Processing: OpenMP parallelization for reduced computation time

**Problem Solved**

Traditional transportation apps suffer from siloed approaches, forcing users to switch between multiple applications to plan comprehensive journeys. This creates friction in trip planning and limits users' ability to discover optimal routes that combine different transportation modes. The Transit App GIS eliminates this fragmentation by providing a unified platform that considers all available transportation options while integrating contextual POI information.

**Impact and Recognition**

Academic Excellence: Top 10 ranking in competitive algorithmic challenge
Innovation Recognition: Successfully identified and addressed previously unmet market need

**Future Development**

The application serves as a foundation for advanced transportation planning tools, with potential expansions into:

Carbon footprint optimization
Accessibility-focused routing options
Machine learning-based route prediction

This project demonstrates expertise in practical problem-solving, algorithm optimization, user interface design, and geographic information systems.
